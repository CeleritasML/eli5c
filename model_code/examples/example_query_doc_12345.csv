---,---,--- How is the mass of an object measured in zero gravity?
Displacement (fluid),Applications of displacement,"in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The weight of the displaced fluid can be found mathematically. The mass of the displaced fluid can be expressed in terms of the density and its volume, m = ρV. The fluid displaced has a weight W = mg, where g is acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, the weight of the displaced fluid can be expressed as W = ρVg.
The weight of an object or substance can be measured by floating a sufficiently buoyant receptacle in the cylinder and noting"
Eötvös experiment,Eötvös's original experiment,"experiments, as well as experiments with different types of materials and in different locations around the Earth, all of which demonstrated the same equivalence in mass. In turn, these experiments led to the modern understanding of the equivalence principle encoded in general relativity, which states that the gravitational and inertial masses are the same.
It is sufficient for the inertial mass to be proportional to the gravitational mass. Any multiplicative constant will be absorbed in the definition of the unit of force. Eötvös's original experiment Eötvös's original experimental device consisted of two masses on opposite ends of a rod, hung from"
Weight,Measuring,"weights are calibrated at the factory for standard gravity, the balance will measure standard weight, i.e. what the object would weigh at standard gravity, not the actual local force of gravity on the object.
If the actual force of gravity on the object is needed, this can be calculated by multiplying the mass measured by the balance by the acceleration due to gravity – either standard gravity (for everyday work) or the precise local gravity (for precision work). Tables of the gravitational acceleration at different locations can be found on the web.
Gross weight is a term that is generally found in"
Mass versus weight,Overview,"varies in proportion to the strength of the gravitational field, its mass is constant, as long as no energy or matter is added to the object. For example, although a satellite in orbit (essentially a free-fall) is ""weightless"", it still retains its mass and inertia. Accordingly, even in orbit, an astronaut trying to accelerate the satellite in any direction is still required to exert force, and needs to exert ten times as much force to accelerate a 10‑ton satellite at the same rate as one with a mass of only 1 ton. Overview Mass is (among other properties) an inertial property;"
Mass versus weight,Converting units of mass to equivalent forces on Earth & Buoyancy and weight,"mass of objects like concrete and automobiles (expressed in kilograms) to a force in newtons (by multiplying by some factor around 9.8; 2 significant figures is usually sufficient for such calculations) to derive the load of the object. Material properties like elastic modulus are measured and published in terms of the newton and pascal (a unit of pressure related to the newton). Buoyancy and weight Usually, the relationship between mass and weight on Earth is highly proportional; objects that are a hundred times more massive than a one-liter bottle of soda almost always weigh a hundred times more—approximately 1,000 newtons,"
Added mass,Background,"i.e. divided by the fluid density times the volume of the body. In general, the added mass is a second-order tensor, relating the fluid acceleration vector to the resulting force vector on the body. Background Friedrich Bessel proposed the concept of added mass in 1828 to describe the motion of a pendulum in a fluid.  The period of such a pendulum increased relative to its period in a vacuum (even after accounting for buoyancy effects), indicating that the surrounding fluid increased the effective mass of the system.
The concept of added mass is arguably the first example of renormalization in"
Alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram,Ampere-based force,"an electric current of this precise quantity of elementary charges per second passing a given point in an electric circuit.
The virtue of a practical realisation based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, all of which require the careful characterisation of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates the magnitude of the kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical realisation based upon accelerating masses. Experiments over a period of years in Japan with a"
Mass versus weight,Overview,"the Moon as on Earth; they would, however, drop into the pockets much more slowly.
In the physical sciences, the terms ""mass"" and ""weight"" are rigidly defined as separate measures, as they are different physical properties. In everyday use, as all everyday objects have both mass and weight and one is almost exactly proportional to the other, ""weight"" often serves to describe both properties, its meaning being dependent upon context. For example, in retail commerce, the ""net weight"" of products actually refers to mass, and is expressed in mass units such as grams or ounces (see also Pound: Use in commerce)."
Center of mass,In two dimensions,"drop plumb lines from the suspension points. The intersection of the two lines is the center of mass.
The shape of an object might already be mathematically determined, but it may be too complex to use a known formula. In this case, one can subdivide the complex shape into simpler, more elementary shapes, whose centers of mass are easy to find. If the total mass and center of mass can be determined for each area, then the center of mass of the whole is the weighted average of the centers. This method can even work for objects with holes, which can"
Weight,Gravitational definition,"a force: the weight of a body is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity.
— Resolution 2 of the 3rd General Conference on Weights and Measures
This resolution defines weight as a vector, since force is a vector quantity. However, some textbooks also take weight to be a scalar by defining:
""The weight W of a body is equal to the magnitude Fg of the gravitational force on the body.""
The gravitational acceleration varies from place to place. Sometimes, it is simply taken to have a standard value of 9.80665 m/s², which gives the standard weight.
The force whose magnitude is"
