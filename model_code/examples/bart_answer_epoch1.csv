How is the mass of an object measured in zero gravity?,"The mass of an object is a measure of how much force is applied to the object. The mass of the object is determined by the amount of force the object exerts on the air. The weight of the air is proportional to the mass of that air, so the air exerts the same force on the object as the air around it.","The mass of an object is a measure of how much force is applied to the object.

Why do major competitors such as Burger King and McDonalds put their restaurants right next to each other?,"There are a lot of reasons. The first is that it's cheaper to build a McDonald's than it is to build the McDonald's.

"The universe is a 3D space, yet our planets are aligned on a 2D plane. Why?","We don't know for sure, but it's believed that it's because of the conservation of angular momentum. Think of it this way: Imagine you're standing on a merry-go-round. You're sitting on the floor all day, and you're sitting in the chair all day long. You are standing on the chair, and the chair is sitting on a chair. The chair is standing on one side of your chair, so it's sitting on one floor. If you stand on one chair, it's standing on your chair. If your chair was standing on that chair, you'd be standing on it all day. But if you stand in a chair and stand on the couch all day and walk on it, the chair would be sitting on top of the chair. That's the same principle.","We don't know for sure, but it's believed that it's because of the conservation of angular momentum. Think of it this way: Imagine you're standing on a merry-go-round.

Can someone simplify polar vs nonpolar molecules?,"It depends on the chemical properties of the molecule. In the case of polar molecules, polar molecules are less polar than non-polar molecules. Polar molecules are more electrically charged than nonpolar ones, so they don't have to be electrically neutral to have a positive charge. They also have a negative charge.","It depends on the chemical properties of the molecule. In the case of polar molecules, polar molecules are less polar than non-polar molecules.
